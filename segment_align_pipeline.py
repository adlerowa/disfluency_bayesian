# scripts/segment_align_pipeline.py
# Placeholder: implement segmentation, ASR, and alignment steps here.
# Suggested steps:
# 1) Segment audio with VAD into 10–15s windows (pyannote.audio or webrtcvad).
# 2) Run ASR (e.g., Whisper) with no normalization to preserve fillers.
# 3) Compute pause durations from timestamps; threshold at >=200–250 ms.
# 4) (Optional) Apply a sequence tagger for repairs/false starts.
# 5) Align source↔interp segments via timestamps or semantic similarity.
# 6) Aggregate counts by segment and write to schema/df_analysis.csv.
